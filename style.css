Write a code of a resume site 

ChatGPT
As an AI language model, I cannot write and publish the code for a website. However, I can provide you with an overview of what a basic code for a resume site may look like.

The first step would be to create the HTML structure of the website, including the header, body, and footer. Here's an example of how the basic structure of the HTML code for a resume website would look like:

php
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Vipin Pratap's Resume</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <!-- Header content goes here -->
    </header>

    <main>
      <!-- Main content goes here -->
    </main>

    <footer>
      <!-- Footer content goes here -->
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
After creating the basic HTML structure, you can add the main content of the website. This may include your name, contact information, education, work experience, skills, and other relevant information. Here is an example of how the HTML code for a resume website may look like:

less
Copy code
<main>
  <h1>Vipin Pratap</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Email: vipinpratap@email.com</li>
    <li>Phone: 123-456-7890</li>
    <li>LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/vipinpratap</li>

Finally, you would need to add a CSS stylesheet to style your website and make it visually appealing. Here's an example of how the CSS code for a resume website may look like:

css
Copy code
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: #333;
}
